Volume of transfers of major arms
Figures are in millions of SIPRI trend-indicator values (TIVs).
A '0' indicates that the volume of deliveries is between 0 and 0.5 million SIPRI TIV. An empty field indicates that no deliveries have been identified.
Figures may not add up to stated totals due to the conventions of rounding.
